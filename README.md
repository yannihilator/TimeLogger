# TimeLogger
Time Logger is a simple web application that helps you track your workday conveniently while keeping your data local.
Its main scope is to keep proprietary organization information local to your machine, while giving similar functionality and featuers to applications such as Clockify.

As a beginner, this project served as my introduction to conventional web development centered around JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and its premise was used for educational purposes. This applicaion is made up predominately of vanilla JavaScript, with minimal uses of JQuery.
For the user interface design, Bootstrap 4 was utilized to give the application a sleek and responsive touch. 

### Future Work
* Create more sustainable local storage method 
* Add visuals of metrics and data
* Migrate to Electon.js platform, thus minimizing browser inconsistency issues
